Client for [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org), the Free Software repository system
for Android.

## Building with Gradle

    ./gradlew assembleRelease

## Direct download

You can [download the application](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk) directly
from our site or [browse it in the repo](https://f-droid.org/app/com.team420.kekstore).

## Contributing

See our [Contributing doc](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to report
issues, translate the app into your language or help with development.

## IRC

We are on `#fdroid` and `#fdroid-dev` on Freenode. We hold weekly dev meetings
on `#fdroid-dev` on Thursdays at 11:30h UTC, which usually last half an hour.

## FAQ

* Why does F-Droid require "Unknown Sources" to install apps by default?

Because a regular Android app cannot act as a package manager on its
own. To do so, it would require system privileges (see below), similar
to what Google Play does.

* Can I avoid enabling "Unknown Sources" by installing F-Droid as a
  privileged system app?

This used to be the case, but no longer is. Now the [Privileged
Extension](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/privileged-extension) is the one that should be placed in
the system. It can be bundled with a ROM or installed via a zip.
