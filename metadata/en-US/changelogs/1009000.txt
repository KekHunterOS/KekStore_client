* Removed "Android App Link" support since it cannot work with F-Droid, and it was triggering DNS leaks.
* Archive Repos are now lower priority than the Repo (higher on the Manage Repos screen), fixing issues where it looked for icons, screenshots and other information in the Archive rather than the Repo itself.
* Stop cropping feature header image (thanks @ByteHamster!)
* Make navigation bar match dark mode (thanks @MatthieuB!)
* Cleaned out obsolete code (thanks @Isira-Seneviratne!)
